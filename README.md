# Blood-Bank-Management-System
The Blood Bank Management System functions by integrating PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL to facilitate streamlined processes. Donor information is collected and stored in a database, enabling easy access and management. The system tracks the inventory of available blood, including types and expiration dates, ensuring a comprehensive overview of stock levels. When a request for blood is made, the system matches the criteria with available donations, allowing for efficient allocation. The admin dashboard provides an interface for overseeing these operations, enabling administrators to monitor inventory, manage donor information, and fulfill blood requests promptly. Overall, it automates and centralizes blood supply management, optimizing the process from donation to distribution for effective healthcare support.
